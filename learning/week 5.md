Things that you're expected to learn this week
---
**Please note -- when I say _learn_, I expect you to trial it _on your own system_ and gain a proficiency level where you are comfortable talking about the concepts, and are able to perform basic implementations using them.**
1. Learn `markdown` -- this file is written using it See [this.](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
2. Basic PHP -- learn the concepts of [Unit Testing](https://jtreminio.com/2013/03/unit-testing-tutorial-introduction-to-phpunit/)

##Laravel Specifics

1. Request routing, see https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/routing
2. Implementing controllers, see https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/controllers
3. Sending arbitrary responses, see https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/responses
4. Introduction to validation, see https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/validation
5. Introduction to session handling (bonus: learn what a session is first), see https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/session
6. Templating in Laravel (or "How to avoid code soup"), see https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/views and https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/blade
7. Interfacing with the Database using the ORM, see 
    1. https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/database
    2. https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/queries
    3. https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/queries

8. Learn about middlewares, see https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/middleware

In addition, please bookmark https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/ -- there are many topics that I am not touching on (such as Inversion of Control / DI containers, default scaffolding for many services and so on).

If web development is interesting to you, please make time for them and learn them at your own leisure.
